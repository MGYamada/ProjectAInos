# P⊗AI (Project AInos)

*Final answer to Hilbert's sixth problem*

P⊗AI is pronounced `poai`.

**P⊗AI (Project AInos)** aims to formalize the whole of theoretical physics in Lean 4. Its planned proof library will make each theory's assumptions explicit, derive its central results, and formalize how theories relate through special cases and limits.
